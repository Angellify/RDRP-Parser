<h1>Known Issues:</h1>

If you encounter any issues or bugs while using the parser, please don't hesitate to report them to Angellify or anyone else in the development staff. We are dedicated to making the program as reliable and user-friendly as possible, and your feedback is crucial to that effort.

</p>
<h1>How to use:</h1>
<p> The Parser is straight forward, just set your RedM Path to your RedM\RedM.app\logs folder. Your save path can be anywhere you want, a folder will be automatically created with the current month and inside your text log will appear with today's date. 
The Parser gets the last modified chatlog.txt from your RedM path and parses it. A new chatlog.txt file is made each time RedM opens and closes. As long as the parser stays open it will continue writing to the same text file.</p>
<h1>Features:</h1>
<p>The Chatlog Parser is packed with powerful features that make it easy to work with log files and documents. Some of its key capabilities include the ability to parse the latest log file, save to any document, and minimize to the system tray.

These features are just the beginning, and more developments are in the works. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
